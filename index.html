    <h1>As Tenant Protections Fade, Evictions Climb in Queens and Brooklyn</h1>
    <h2>Analysis of 2017-2024 trends in eviction data reveals increased pressure on tenants post-COVID.</h2>

    <!-- STORY STARTS HERE -->
<div class="story">
    <p>Over the last eight years, eviction patterns in New York City have varied across boroughs. Between the period of 2017 and 2024, evictions in Queens and Brooklyn had different volumes but some similarities came through in the data. During this period there were 28,790 evictions in Brooklyn and 20,398 evictions in Queens. The analysis of this data examined evictions to understand how housing instability has evolved across these two boroughs and what the trends suggest about renter vulnerability.</p> 
 </div>

<div class="story">
    <p>The chart, titled “Evictions in New York City: Queens vs. Brooklyn 2017-2024,” compares annual eviction totals in both Queens and Brooklyn. The x-axis represents each year across an eight-year period (2017-2024). The y-axis measures the number of evictions to show a year-by-year comparison. Two lines distinguish Queens (dotted line) from Brooklyn (solid line).</p>
</div>

 <br>

<div class="story">
    <p>Overall, the data reflects a distinct period of time in history, with the 2020 pandemic impacting the financial situations of renters. In 2020 and 2021, eviction moratoriums were placed by both New York State and the United States federal government. During this time, there was a decline in eviction rates across Queens and Brooklyn. Brooklyn, which historically reports some of the highest eviction totals in the city, saw a steep decline during this period. Queens also experienced a decline but not quite as dramatic of a decline as Brooklyn. A possible factor contributing to this outcome could be that Queens has a higher concentration of smaller buildings, which might have a lower eviction reporting rate.</p>

<div class="story">
     <p>Section 8 housing vouchers are a rental subsidy for low-income families to use towards housing. Though voucher holders in New York City have some of the lowest eviction rates, discrimination against those holding vouchers has increased according to the findings of New York City’s Committee on Civil and Human Rights. Legal Aid Society staff attorney, Robert Desir said “we are seeing a progression of tenant protections being gutted and that burden falling on New York City.” He highlighted a “new sophistication in landlord tactics” used to discriminate against voucher holders.</p>

<!-- WRAPUP THE STORY HERE -->
<div class="story">
    <p>In 2022, renter protections were lifted. As a result there was an increase in evictions in both Queens and Brooklyn. Brooklyn had a steeper increase and returned closer to pre-pandemic levels by 2024. Queens experienced a more gradual incline in eviction rates.</p> 
 </div>
  <br>

 <div class="story">
    <p>While eviction numbers in Queens and Brooklyn have not returned to pre-pandemic levels, the rise in evictions indicates changes in economic instability for renters across boroughs.</p>
